# MyReads Project
This repository contains MyReads, a project assignment for the Udacity's React Nanodegree.

MyReads consists on a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that is used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.

To run the application, navigate into the project root folder and run `npm install`

After all the dependences have been installed, run `npm start`

This will deploy the application locally and will allow you to access MyReads in the browser.
